## Project Overview

URL-SM is a mini-project built with the following technology stack:

**Frontend:**
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios
- Vite

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- SendGrid (for sending email notifications)

The frontend code is deployed on Netlify, and the backend code is deployed on Render. Please note that the server on Render may experience some inactivity-related delays as it is deployed for free.

## Functionalities

URL-SM offers the following key functionalities:

1. **Signup and Email Verification**: New users can sign up with their details, and an email with an OTP is sent to the provided email address for verification. Users can also request a resend of the OTP, which invalidates the old OTP.

2. **Password Encryption**: User passwords are securely encrypted and stored in the database using the bcrypt.js package.

3. **Signin and Token Generation**: Registered users can sign in, and upon successful authentication, a token is generated by the server and sent to the client. This token is automatically verified, allowing the user to access the app until it expires.

4. **Password Reset**: Users who forget their passwords can initiate a password reset process by providing their registered email address. A link to reset the password is sent to the email, and the link becomes invalid once used.

5. **URL Shortening**: Users can enter URLs of any length and receive a shortened URL with a unique ID generated using the nanoid package. When this shortened URL is used, it redirects to the original URL.

6. **Dashboard**: Users can view all the shortened URLs they've created in their dashboard, along with usage statistics. They can also permanently delete the created URLs.

7. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive for both small and large screens, ensuring a seamless user experience on various devices.
